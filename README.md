# CRUD-Application
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application in React involves setting up a basic frontend interface that can interact with a backend service to perform these operations. Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing a simple CRUD app in React.

src/
  components/
    UserList.js
    UserForm.js
  App.js
  index.js

  - The UserList component will display the list of users and provide options to edit or delete them.
  - The UserForm component will handle creating and updating users.
  - The App component will manage the state and handle CRUD operations.
